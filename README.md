## Why and what is it?

Sensors Simulator is the project that I decided to create for the Object Oriented Programming class during the 2023/2024 academic year at the University of Padua.

Sensors Simulator is a widget application that allows you to create, modify, delete, search, sort, and save sensors as JSON. These sensors can be of three different types: AirQuality, Humidity, and Temperature. Based on statistical parameters, the sensor simulates the behavior of the environmental condition it represents.

## Requirements

To compile Sensor Simulator you need:

- A version of c++14 or higher
- QMake (3.1 or higher) or CMake (3.22 or higher) (depending on the OS)
- The Qt framework, version 6.2.4 or higher.

## Build

To build the project you need to:

- Enter the `src` folder
- Use the following command: `qmake`
- Use the following command: `make`
- Now that your executable is compiled, use `./Pao_Sensori_Ecc` to execute it
  
## Documentation

There is a technical sheet about the project (written in italian), you can find it in the
[Pao_progetto.pdf](./Pao_progetto.pdf).
